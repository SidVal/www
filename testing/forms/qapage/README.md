## Info

- Only use the `QAPage` markup if your page has information in a question and answer format, which is one question followed by zero or more answers.
- Donâ€™t use `QAPage` markup for advertising purposes.
- Make sure each `Question` includes the entire text of the question and make sure each Answer includes the entire text of the answer.
- `Answer` markup is for answers to the question, not for comments on the question or comments on other answers. Do not markup non-answer comments as an Answer.
- Question and answer content may not be displayed as a rich result if it contains any of the following types of content: obscene, profane, sexually explicit, graphically violent, promotion of dangerous or illegal activities, or hateful or harassing language.
